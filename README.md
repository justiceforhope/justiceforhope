- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @justiceforhope
- Sept 24 I will begin working on my BA in CS with a concentration of software development.  
- I have dreamed of learning to code for as long as I can remember but hadn't made time until not to work towards that dream.
- I am on github with the intention of learning anything and everything that I can about coding, language, and open source.  
- I hope to make connections within the commnity and hopefully find a mentor or 5 to communicate and possibly collaborate throughout my educational journey.
- I am impressed beyond words with the work all of you put in here on github and I cannot find words to express my gratitude, to be able to watch as you change the world one stroke at a time.
- üíûÔ∏è I don't know that I can be of assistance to anyone, but I would love to help if there is any way that I can please do not hesitate to contact me.  I am happy to fetch coffee, take notes, or walk the puppies.  It would be unrealistic to think I could help anyone in the coding process but I would be so happy and grateful for an opportunity to help any of you, even in the smallest ways.  I am unsure if there is anything someone can help with if theyh are not experieced in coding (proof reading, data collection, data entry????????????????????) if someone needs anything similar please reach out anytime!
- I look forward to connecting with all of you and being a part of the community.
- üì´ Please email me at justiceforhope@gmail.com
